\subsubsection{\label{counter-example}Detailed example of a failed execution}

%TODO try to define a macro for figures

\paragraph{}
We here present an example of an execution which fails with the algorithm
described in~\cite{JS94}. The input of the algorithm is as follows~:
\begin{itemize}
\item $G$ is the graph drawn in Figure~\ref{FE_K2_init},
\item $k = 2$,
\item $\mathrm{roots} = \{ e, a \}$,
\item $\mathrm{partitionSize} = \{ 5, 7\}$.
\end{itemize}

% an array of execution should be given and different colors for components
\paragraph{}
In order to illustrate the status of the algorithm, edges which are
included in a tree have a stronger thickness, while both edges and vertices are
colored according to the tree they belong to. Additionally, an array is
presented under each graph, showing the content of the tree-node array which
is used by the algorithm to choose which action has to be executed.

\paragraph{}
During the first two steps, each partition needs to acquire more vertices, so
each one grows by adding all the available neighborhood.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 3, two vertices are available to increase the size of the current
working tree: $i$ and $j$. Since it needs only one of the two vertices, say
$j$,  is chosen.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 4, the tree rooted at $a$ cannot be simply extended, since every
adjacent vertex belongs to the other tree. The adjacent free vertices are $f$ and
$g$. Both respect the conditions necessary to allow the swapping. According to
the algorithm, the vertex to swap must have the lowest degree in the concerned
tree among the swappable candidates. It cannot be $g$ since it has a higher
internal degree than $f$ in the concerned tree. The swapped vertex is then $f$.

\begin{figure}[H]

\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 5, the tree rooted at $e$ must get one vertex back, since the other
tree has taken one of its vertices. The two free candidates are $i$ and $k$.
Since only one is missing, only one must be added. In our case, $i$ is added.

\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 6, the tree rooted at $a$ has no available adjacent vertex, it then
has to swap a vertex among the neighborhood: $e$,$g$,$h$,$i$. $e$ is not an
option since it is the root of the other tree. Since $g$ has an internal degree
of 2, it cannot be choosen since $h$ and $i$ have an internal degree of 1.
The swapped vertex is then $h$ or $i$. Since nothing in the algorithm
determines which one must be chosen, $h$ might be swapped at that step.

\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 7, the tree rooted at $e$ must add a vertex among $k$ and $l$, the
vertex $k$ can be freely added with the edge $\{i,k\}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \caption{Failed Execution : Step 7}

\hline
$T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_e$ & $T_e, T_a$ & $T_e$ & $T_e, T_a$ & $T_e$ & $T_e$ & $T_e$ &\\
\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
At step 8, the tree rooted at $a$ must take a last vertex but, since it has no
available
adjacent vertex, it must then take a vertex from the tree rooted at $e$. The
swappable vertices are $g$ and $i$. Since they both have the
same internal degree in the concerned tree, $g$ can be choosen as a valid
choice for the extension.

\paragraph{}
By swapping with $g$, the subtree rooted at $g$ must be cut from the tree
rooted at $e$. All the removed vertices ($i$,$j$,$k$) are then set back as
unexplored, but not the swapped vertex $g$.

\hline
a & b & c & d & e & f & g & h & i & j & k & l\\
\hline
$T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_a$ & $T_e$ & $T_e, T_a$ & $T_e,T_a$ & $T_e, T_a$ & & &  &\\
\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
After step 8, we are in a situation where the algorithm is stucked in a
dead-loop. The tree rooted at $a$ has the right amount of vertices, and steps
concerning this tree will not produce any modification. The tree rooted at $e$
cannot expand anymore, because all the adjacent vertices have already belong to
him\footnote{See line 28 of the algorithm} and have not been reset\footnote{
See line 47 of the algorithm}.
