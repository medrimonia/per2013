\section{Field}
In this subsection, definitions about the graph theory will be presented. Most
of the following definitions are taken from or inspired by wikipedia and
wikibook.

\subsubsection{Type of graphs}
\paragraph{Undirected simple graphs :}
An undirected simple graph is a mathematical objects composed of a set of
vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$ and is noted $G = (V,E)$.

%TODO eventually ref for other names in Diestel (nodes/...)
\paragraph{}
A vertex is a mathematical objects which might virtually represent anything.

\paragraph{}
An edge is an unordered pair of different vertices and is noted $\{u,v\}$,
sometimes it can also be contracted to the following notation $uv$.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Directed graphs :} 
A directed simple graph is a graph with edges defined as ordered pairs
$e = (u,v)$ rather than a two-element set $e = \{u,v\}$, $u$ is called the
head of the edge and $v$ is the tail of the edge.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Subgraphs :}
Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a graph $G' = (V',E')$, $G'$ is a subgraph of $G$ 
if and only if $V \subseteq V'$ and $E \subseteq E'$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/subgraphExample.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A graph and one of his subgraph (in green)}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Tree :}
A tree is an undirected simple connected\footnote{See \ref{defConnectivity}}
graph wthout cycle.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/treeExample.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A tree}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Spanning Tree :}
A tree $T$ is a spanning tree of a graph $G$ if it includes every vertex of $G$ 
and is a subgraph of $G$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/spanningTreeExample.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A spanning tree (in green)}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Complete Graphs :}
According to~\cite{Diestel}:\\
If all the vertices of $G$ are pairwise adjacent, then $G$ is complete. A
complete graph on $n$ vertices is a $K^n$.

%TODO fundamentals notation before Types of graphs?
\subsubsection{Fundamentals notation}
\paragraph{Graph Size :}
The size of a graph $G$ is its number of edges, i.e. $|E(G)|$.

\paragraph{Graph order :}
The order of a graph $G$ is its number of vertices, i.e. $|V(G)|$.

\paragraph{Adjacent :}
Two vertices, $u$ and $v$, are adjacent in a simple graph $G$, if and only if
there's an edge of $G$ which contains $u$ and $v$, i.e. $\{u,v\} \in E(G)$.

\paragraph{Vertex degree :}
The degree of a vertex in a simple undirected graph is equal to the number of
vertices adjacent to it.

\subsubsection{Path}
\paragraph{Path :}
From~\cite{Diestel} :\\
A path is a non-empty graph $P = (V, E)$ of the form
$$ V = \{x_0,x_1, \dots, x_k \} \;\;\; E=\{x_0x_1, x_1x_2, \dots, x_{k-1}x_k \}$$
where the $x_i$ are all distinct. The vertices $x_0$ and $x_k$ are {\em linked}
by $P$ and are called its {\em ends}; the vertices $x_1, \dots, x_{k-1}$ are the
{\em inner} vertices of $P$. The number of {\em edges} of path is its
{\em length}, and the path of length $k$ is denoted by $P^k$. Note that $k$ is
allowed to be zero; thus, $P^0 = K^1$.
%TODO : explains K before

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cuts}
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.
\paragraph{Cut :}
A cut $C=(S,T)$ is a partition of $V$ into two disjoint subsets that are joined by at least one edge.

\paragraph{Cut-set :}
The cut-set of a cut $C=(S,T)$ is the set of edge defined as $\{(u,v)\in E | u\in S, v \in T\}$.

\paragraph{Cut Size :}
The size of a cut is the number of edges in the cut-set.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/cutExample.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A cut-set (in green)}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Minimum Cut :} 
The minimum cut is the cut with the lowest size. 

\paragraph{Vertex Cut :}
A vertex cut $C=V'$ is a subset $V'$ of $V$ such that $G-V'$ becomes
disconnected.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/vertexCutExample.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A vertex cut (in green)}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Vertex Cut Size :}
The size of the  vertex cut is the size of the subset $V'$

\paragraph{Minimum Vertex Cut :}
The minimum vertex cut is the vertex cut with the lowest size.

\subsubsection{Flow}
\paragraph{Flow Network}
A flow network is a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ whose edges have a non-negative
capacity, i.e. $\forall (u,v) \in E(G), c(u,v) \geq 0$.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/flowNetwork.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A flow network}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Flow :}
Let we distinguish two vertices: a source $s$ and a sink $t$.
A flow is a fonction which associate to each edge $(u,v) \in E$ a real:
$f: V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Capacity constraints : $\forall (u,v) \in E, f(u,v) \leq c(u,v)$
    \item Symetry : $\forall (u,v) \in E, f(u,v) = - f(v,u) $
    \item Flow conservation: $\forall u \in V - \{s,t\}, \sum_{v \in V}f(u,v) = 0$ 
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Maximum-flow Minimum-cut Theorem :}
The max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount
of flow passing from the source node to the sink node is equal to the capacity
of the minimum cut.


\subsubsection{Connectivity}
\paragraph{Connectivity :}\label{defConnectivity}
A graph is {\em connected} if for every pair $(u,v)$ of vertices from the
graph, a path exists from $u$ to $v$. Otherwise, the graph is {\em unconnected}.

\paragraph{k-connexity :}
A graph with at least $k+1$ vertices is $k$ connex, if for every pair of
vertices, there is at least $k$ vertex disjoint paths between these vertices.
%TODO define vertex disjoint paths before
Another definition could be: a graph is $k$-connex if it's minimal vertex cut
is of a size less or equal to $k$.

\paragraph{k-connectivity :}
A graph is $k$-connected if it is $k$-connex and not $k+1$-connex. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \input{graphTikZ/k-connected.tex}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A 2-connected graph}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Menger's theorem :}
The menger's theorem is an important theorem concerning connectivity.
It states the following fact:

Let $G$ be a undirected graph and $u$ and $v$ two distinct vertices.
Then the size of the minimum edge cut for $u$ and $v$ is equal to the maximum
number of pairwise node-independent paths from a to b.


\subsubsection{Partition}
\paragraph{k-partition :}
A set $\{V_1,...,V_k\}$ is a $k$-partition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\forall i, \lceil V_i \rceil$ is connected
    \item $\sum\limits_{i=0}^k|V_i| = |V|$
    \item $\forall i,j \in \{1, \dots, k\}^2, i \neq j, V_i \cap V_j = \emptyset$
\end{itemize}
