\section{Context: $k$-partion of $k$-connected graphs}
Gy{\H o}ri-Lov√°sz Theorem~\cite{GE78,LL77} states that $k$-connected graphs are 
$k$-partitionable for all $k \geq 1$. However the two proofs of this theorem
are not constructive. We are interested in polynomial algorithms which
are capable of finding $k$-partitions in $k$-connected graphs.
