\section{Context: $k$-partion of $k$-connected graphs}
Gy{\H o}ri-Lov√°sz Theorem~\cite{GE78,LL77} state that in a $k$-connected graphs are 
k-partitionable for all $k \geq 1$. However the proof of this theorem
is not constructive. In this context, we are interested in algorithms which
is capables of finding $k$-partition in $k$-connected graphs.
