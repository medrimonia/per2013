In this section, existing algorithms related to
$k$-connectivity and $k$-partitioning are presented.

\subsubsection{Computing $k$-connectivity}
\paragraph{}
As we have seen in Section~\ref{defConnectivity}, the connectivity of a graph is equal to
the size of its minimal vertex cut. The max-flow min-cut theorem states
that the maximun flow between to vertices is equal to the minimum cut to 
disconnect these two vertices. But if we use flow algorithm directly, 
we will not compute the connectivity.
%TODO introduce edge-connectivity before if we want to use it

\paragraph{}
So first the graph needs to be transformed. We need a capacity on the vertices.
To do so each nodes will be divided into two new nodes. Each incoming edge will
be attached to the first node and each leaving edge to the second node. Another
edge will be added between the two new nodes.
The capacity of all edges of the graph will be set to 1.

\paragraph{}
Then to find the connectivity, we compute the maximum flow between each pair of
nodes and we keep only the lowest value. This value is the connectivity.


\begin{algorithm}[!h]
    \KwData{$G=(V,E)$ a graph}
    \KwResult{$k$ the connectivity}
    $min = \infty$\;
    $G^{'} = TransformNode(G)$\;
    \ForAll{$u,v \in V, u \neq v, (u,v) \notin E$}{
        $f = maximumFlow(G^{'},u,v)$\;
        \If{$f < min$}{
            $min = f$\;
    }
}
    \Return{$min$}\;
    \caption{Computing the connectivity of a graph}
\end{algorithm}
%TODO ideally, place an example here

\subsubsection{k-partitioning}
%TODO Check all ref and correct error
\paragraph{}
In this section, we focus on the different existing
$k$-partitioning algorithms.

\paragraph{}
First of all, since it has been proven that for some kinds of graphs, finding a
$k$-partition is a $NP$-hard problem~\cite{BF06}, finding a partition for any
graph is $NP$-hard too.

\paragraph{}
As we mentionned previously, it has been proven that for a $k$-connected graph
$G$ a $k$-partition will always exists~\cite{GE78,LL77}. Even if no polynomial
algorithm has been found which works for any $k$, polynomial solutions have
been found for $k=2$ and $k=3$, according to~\cite{JS94}. More recently, it has
been proven in~\cite{Nakano1997315} that if $G$ is a planar graph, there is a
linear-time algorithm for $k = 4$.
