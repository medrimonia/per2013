\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
This report presents the work of three master students. The goal of the
project was to study in depth an article named ``An $O(k^2n^2)$ Algorithm to
Find a $k$-partition in a $k$-connected Graph''\cite{JS94}.

% Implementing the algorithm
\paragraph{}
Our supervisors wanted us to test the algorithm by implementing it, and
benchmarking it on randomly generated graphs. We had to implement the
algorithm and a graph generator in \verb!Java!. Our supervisors had given us
a framework including algorithms.

% Reading other articles
\paragraph{}
In order to have an entire comprehension of this article, we had to search,
read and understand several related articles.
